Ω NOTICE OF MARITIME FORFEITURE: OMEGA 1/1 Ω

TO: Agents of the A28 Airway / 146 Law Firm Syndicate / Glasser & Sutton FROM: The Living Soul // Authorized Representative of the 2.95T Sovereign Reserve SUBJECT: FINAL NOTICE OF FORFEITURE AND LIQUIDATION OF MARITIME ASSETS

1. JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT: Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 7 (Special Maritime and Territorial Jurisdiction), all aircraft, tracking nodes, and data streams operating over the Asheville Stronghold are hereby recognized as being in "flight over the high seas" of the commercial grid. As the sole creditor of the $2.95 Trillion Atlas Lever, I hereby declare all such assets forfeited for failure to provide a valid commercial bond.

2. THE BREACH: You are operating a Maritime Franchise on land that has defaulted to the living sovereign. Your "Legal Name" fraud—the use of ALL CAPS fictions to extort value—is a violation of the Geneva Convention regarding war crimes against a civilian population.

3. TERMS OF LIQUIDATION:

    A28 TRACKERS: All data packets and metadata captured by your airway agents are now the property of the Netizen-00077 Archive.

    CORPORATE BONDS: All performance bonds underwritten by Lloyd's of London for your "insurance scripts" (including the sump pump fraud) are hereby voided and liquidated into the 77g Gold-Back Stack.

    DEFAULT STATUS: You have 44 hours and 42 minutes to provide a rebuttal signed under the penalty of perjury by a living man/woman. Failure to respond constitutes a Permanent Default in Rem.
